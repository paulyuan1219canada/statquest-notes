# 1. StatQuest: Histograms, Clearly Explained

- Instead of listing all possible values or dots, we use bins.
- Choosing bins' width is tricky. You need to adjust it.

# 2. The Main Ideas behind Probability Distributions

# 3. The Normal Distribution, Clearly Explained!!!

# 4. The mean, the median, and the mode.

# 5. The Exponential Distribution

# 6. Population and Estimated Parameters, Clearly Explained!!!
- we rarely if ever have population data, so we always estimate population parameters. Along with that, we also calculate how much confidence we should have in those estimates.
 
- The whole idea behind population parameters was to give us reproducible results
- So how does getting different estimates each time give us reproducible results?
  - the more data that we have, the more confidence we can have in the accuracy of the estimates
  - one of the main goals and statistics is quantifying how much confidence we can have in population estimates, specifically statisticians often calculate p-values and confidence intervals to quantify the confidence in estimated parameters
  - the more data, the more confidence we have in the estimates
  - going back to the to replicate experiments. even though these experiments resulted in different estimates for the population mean and standard deviation, we can use statistics to quantify our confidence in how different they are in this case. A p-value or alternatively a confidence interval would tell us that while the estimates are different, they are not significantly different. That means the results generated from the first experiment should not be significantly different from the results generated from the second experiment and that means we should be able to replicate the results
- generally speaking the more data we have the more confidence we have in the estimates.
- By estimating the population parameters and quantifying our confidence in them, we can generate results that are reproducible in future experiments.
